        <h1>Inner Child</h1>
        <p>This is a playable game based upon how I have experienced my own life thus far but also how I witnessed the life of the ones around me. The game is about losing our inner child as we advance in life. My character is a kite. It represents the freedom of choice but it also symbolizes our inner child. In my game, we all start with a colorful kite. The player has to advance in the game without losing these colors. The player will have to try to avoid the clouds; each time the kite touches a cloud, one of the colors will become grey. 
    There are 3 scenes in this game: a normal day -to represent most days in our life-, a stormy day -to represent our hardest days- and a sunny day full of rainbows -to represent the days in which we feel like we were given a second chance at life-. Although we might lose many colors during a stormy day, when sunny days come we can try and take back the parts of ourselves we thought we lost. If the player passes over a rainbow, they will retrieve one of the colors they lost. 
    The goal is to reach the end with as many colors as possible on your kite. In my game you cannot know when you have reached the end until you reach it, much like in life you never know what kind of day lays ahead, and when the game is actually over.</p>
